# Mental Health Survey Analysis for University Students
The goal of our designed survey is to understand how university students are affected by stress due to several reasons and what impacts may be caused in their body. By getting a glimpse of how undergraduate students at the University of Toronto are tackling their stress levels, we also try to find the reason of their stress, what symptoms it may cause them physically or emotionally, how stressed they think they are and how healthy do they feel their body is from a day to day basis. Moreover, we may also be able to find other correlations of stress levels with factors such as hours of sleep, age, gender, level of healthiness, academic load (total credits of the year), any specific physical or mental symptom that may occur with higher stress for a majority of individuals, the main cause for students that relates to higher stress and so on.
 
## Research Question
Our research question is, "How does stress affect the hours of sleep for University students?" to find that the true mean of the number of hours of sleep for student population at the University was equal to six hours.
